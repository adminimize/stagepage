# StagePage Data Model Guide for Frontend Development

## 🎭 Overview

StagePage is a digital playbill system for theater festivals and productions. The data model supports complex hierarchical relationships between festivals, productions, shows, people, and events.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

### Core Content Hierarchy

```
Festivals (IMPACT 25)
  ├── Productions (The Seventh Fire - IMPACT 25)
  │   ├── Shows (The Seventh Fire)
  │   ├── Programs (Digital Playbill)
  │   └── Events (Specific Performances)
  └── Programs (Festival-wide program)
```

### Key Relationships

- **Festival** → Many **Productions** → Many **Programs** → Many **Events**
- **Shows** are abstract works that can have multiple **Productions**
- **People** connect to everything via junction tables with roles
- **Organizations** can co-produce **Productions**

## 🔗 Junction Tables & Credits

### Credit System Overview
Credits are tracked at multiple levels using junction tables. This allows:
- Show-level creative team (writers, composers)
- Production-level credits (directors, designers for specific mounting)
- Program-level cast and crew (performers, specific roles)
- Song-level credits (composers, lyricists per song)

### Junction Tables

#### `programs_people`
Program-level credits (cast, crew, featured artists).
```js
{
  programs_id: "program_uuid",
  people_id: "person_uuid",
  role: "role_uuid", // Links to roles table
  role_name_override: "Harold Hill", // Override role name
  bio_override: "Special bio for this production",
  billing_order: 1,
  is_featured: true
}
```

#### `productions_people`
Production-specific credits.
```js
{
  productions_id: "production_uuid",
  people_id: "person_uuid",
  role: "role_uuid"
}
```

#### `shows_people`
Show-level creative team.
```js
{
  shows_id: "show_uuid",
  people_id: "person_uuid",
  role_type: "Composer" // Direct string for creative roles
}
```

#### `songs_people`
Song-specific credits.
```js
{
  songs_id: "song_uuid",
  people_id: "person_uuid",
  roles: "role_uuid"
}
```

## 🪄 The Magic Query Pattern

### Single Query for Complete Program Data

The system's power comes from being able to fetch all related data in one API call:

```js
// Fetch complete program with all relationships
const programData = await directus.items('programs').readOne(programId, {
  fields: [
    '*', // All program fields
    'production.*', // Production details
    'production.show.*', // Show information
    'production.organizations.*', // Co-producing orgs
    'festivals.*', // Festival context
    'events.*', // All performance events
    'events.venue_id.*', // Venue details for each event
    'events.venue_id.address.*', // Full address
    'events.venue_id.address.city.*', // City/province
    'credits.*', // All program credits
    'credits.people_id.*', // Full person details
    'credits.people_id.pronouns.*', // Pronoun preferences
    'credits.role.*', // Role information
    'songs.*', // All songs in program
    'songs.credits.*', // Song credits
    'songs.credits.people_id.*' // Song credit person details
  ]
});
```

### Deep Nested Syntax

Use dot notation to traverse relationships:
- `production.show.title` - Show title through production
- `credits.people_id.full_name` - Person name through credits
- `events.venue_id.address.city.name` - City name through venue
- `festivals.title` - Festival title (if program belongs to festival)

### Wildcard Usage

- `*` - All fields at current level
- `credits.*` - All fields in credits junction table
- `credits.people_id.*` - All person fields through credits

## 🎯 Frontend Implementation Strategies

### 1. Virtual Program Concept

Programs can represent:
- **Production-specific programs** - Traditional playbill for one show
- **Festival-wide programs** - Umbrella document covering multiple productions
- **Event-specific programs** - Special materials for galas, opening nights

### 2. Credit Aggregation

When displaying credits, merge from multiple levels:
1. Start with show-level creative team
2. Add production-level credits (directors, designers)
3. Include program-level cast and crew
4. Handle conflicts with billing_order

### 3. Bio Management

People can have:
- `default_bio` - Standard bio
- `bio_override` in junction tables - Context-specific bio
- Priority: junction bio_override > default_bio

### 4. Role Name Flexibility

Roles can be:
- **Global roles** - Reusable (Director, Choreographer)
- **Show-specific roles** - Character names (Harold Hill, Marian Paroo)
- **Overrideable** - Use `role_name_override` for variations

## 🔄 Common Query Patterns

### Get Festival with All Productions
```js
const festival = await directus.items('festivals').readOne(festivalId, {
  fields: ['*', 'productions.*', 'productions.show.*', 'programs.*']
});
```

### Get Production with Complete Cast
```js
const production = await directus.items('productions').readOne(productionId, {
  fields: [
    '*',
    'show.*',
    'credits.*',
    'credits.people_id.*',
    'credits.role.*',
    'programs.*',
    'programs.credits.*',
    'programs.credits.people_id.*'
  ]
});
```

### Get Person with All Credits
```js
const person = await directus.items('people').readOne(personId, {
  fields: [
    '*',
    'programs.*',
    'programs.production.*',
    'productions.*', 
    'shows.*',
    'songs.*'
  ]
});
```

## 🚀 Performance Tips

1. **Use specific field lists** - Don't always use `*` in production
2. **Limit nested depth** - Only fetch what you need
3. **Cache program data** - Programs change infrequently
4. **Pagination for lists** - Use `limit` and `offset` for large datasets
5. **Filter at API level** - Use Directus filters rather than client-side filtering

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Override Fields to Add
- `understudy_tracking` in junction tables
- `performance_specific_cast` for events
- `bio_approval_status` for editorial workflow
- `credit_type` categories (cast, creative, crew, featured)

### Billing Order Strategy
- Define clear precedence rules
- Handle conflicts when same person has multiple roles
- Support custom ordering per context

This system provides maximum flexibility while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex theater production workflows.
